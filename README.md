# Useful Bits of code and functions

## Binding Vectors of Unequal Length
  - Self explanatory, used to rbind 2 data frames

## Install Packages Stepwise
  - When computer's antivirus software can't keep up with rate of package install, you can do this to manually click through it to slow it down. Not as efficient as "Slow Down Package Install"

## Repeated Testing Table Function
  - If running many t-tests, or models, or whatever, you can print the individual variables that change with each iteration and their corresponding p-value. Good for exploratory analysis with many univariate models.
  
## table1
  -table 1 function
  
## padNAs
  -Allows you to bind columns of unequal length, pads the shorter list with NAs
  
## pretty row_levels 
  -Retrieve the number of rows/levels in dataframe of matrix with commas inserted for nice reports
  
## summarizeSE
  - Gives count, mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and confidence interval (default 95%).
